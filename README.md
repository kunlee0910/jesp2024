Code files 'emp_EULFS' and 'emp_usa' include codes to calculate gender-education-age-specific employment rates in each country from the microdata of the EU Labour Force Survey and the US Current Population Survey.
I do not have permission to post microdata here.

To replicate the results in the published paper, you can use 'setup' and 'main analysis' files. 'bootstrap' and 'coefficient plots' include ways to estimate dynamic effects from error correction models.
'supplementary' file includes analysis used in the Online Appendix. 'descriptive graphs' is to illustrate country-specific time trends of main independent and dependent variables.
