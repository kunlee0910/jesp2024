Code files emp_EULFS and emp_usa include codes to calculate gender-education-age-specific employment rates in each country from the microdata of EU Labour Force Survey and US Current Population Survey.
I am not allowed to post microdata here.

To replicate the results in the publisehd paper, you can use 'setup' and 'main analysis' files. 'bootstrap' and 'coefficient plots' include ways to estimate dynamic effects from error correction models.
'supplementary' file includes analysis used in the Online Appendix. 'descriptive graphs' is to illustrate country-specific time trends of main independent and dependent variables.
